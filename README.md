- Hi, I’m @higuys77-hpchromex360
- I’m currently trying to download kali linux onto a hpchromebookx360 dual processor, so when i first enable dev mode it never prompts me to turn os verification off i wondered  what would be a issue but i still went forward with the install and ive had issues the whole way im new to codeing and kali maybe a little advanced but still would appreciate any help thank you
  so currently ive enabled dev mode and downloaded virtual box this is first time ive done it this way,i tried to dual boot and then tried to make a live usb i would have to go back and see about the dual why it didnt work
- the live install i couldnt find where to change the boot order, but even when i tried to do it, it gave me an option to boot from external but said was no os on the external. i flashed using utility recovery tool.
- How to reach me ...first time on this but if need to reach me, my email faulknerb7799@gmail.com
